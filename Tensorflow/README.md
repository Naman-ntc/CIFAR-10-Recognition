# Tensorflow
These are tensorflow implementations of some small convNets over CIFAR-10 dataset. There are 4 different models chosen out of many implemented and tested for good performance.

### Performance

| Model Number 		| Accuracy |
|-------------------|----------|
|[Model-1](Model-1)	|
|[Model-2](Model-2)	|
|[Model-3](Model-3)	|
|[Model-4](Model-4)	|
